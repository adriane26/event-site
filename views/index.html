							<p>At most tech conferences, you’re another face in the crowd. We’ve designed Microsoft Interop Events to host fewer attendees to allow our team to provide the personalized attention you need. We create a learning environment and open dialogue to build relationships with the people who use Microsoft tools in real life. You’ll work directly with Microsoft developers to create and test your projects, so you can get answers to all your questions—no more searching <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>!</p>

							<p>We travel around the world to work with developers like you to build relationships based on mutual learning, support, and little fun. We want to get to know you, learn from your experiences, answer your questions, and provide our expertise. To put it another way, we want to sit down with you and dig into the code!
							</p>
							<p>We teach you and you teach us. Each event is an opportunity for our team to learn what developers want from Microsoft and how they use our products. You give us invaluable outside perspective that we can't get from behind our keyboards.</p>
