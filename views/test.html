							<p>At Microsoft Interop Events we don't want to stand at a podium and lecture to a crowd, we want to help developers turn ideas into reality. Our goal is to create a learning environment with an open dialogue between the developer community and Microsoft, where we can help you learn how to use Microsoft tools to create the next generation of technology and we can learn how to make those tools better.</p>

							<p>We travel around the world to work with developers like you to build relationships based on mutual learning, support, and little fun. We want to get to know you, learn from your experiences, answer your questions, and provide our expertise. To put it another way, we want to sit down with you and dig the code!
							</p>
							<p>We teach you and you teach us. Each event is an opportunity for our team to learn what developers want from Microsoft and how they use our products. You give us invaluable outside perspective that we can't get from behind our keyboards.</p>

							<p>Get Microsoft product help directly from the people who designed it. There is no need to scour online docs and help forums when Microsoft engineers are standing right in front of you. Our team is comprised of software engineers and program managers with experience in Microsoft interoperability, Office, Windows, SQL Server, Azure, Cortana, OData, Power BI, and more. Each event is hosted by the people who know our products inside and out. There is no one better to answer your questions and help you solve a problem. You can <a href="/meet-the-team">Meet the Team</a> to learn more about each Microsoft member’s experience and specialties. </p>

							<p>Microsoft interop events are free. Microsoft interoperability events are focused on building knowledge, not selling tickets.  The fundamentals of Microsoft Open Specifications and interoperability are based on providing technical training and documentation free of charge.<img class="float-left" style="height: 200px;" src="./img/interop-logo.png" /></p>
							<p>We are aligned with the open specifications' values, because we believe you should have access to the latest interoperability knowledge and product support for free. It’s your event, our treat—we'll even cover lunch! </p>
