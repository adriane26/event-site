        <p>At most tech conferences, you’re another face in the crowd. We’ve designed Microsoft Interop Events to host fewer attendees to allow our team to provide the personalized attention you need. We create a learning environment and open dialogue to build relationships with the people who use Microsoft tools in real life. You’ll work directly with Microsoft developers to create and test your projects, so you can get answers to all your questions—no more searching <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a>!</p>
