			<p>To create a new event, click on the "Events" tab in the admin menu, then clik on the orange "Add New" button. This will bring you to the New Event form where you can create new events. The minimum needed to create an event are the "Event Name", "Event URL", "Event Location", and some content in the "About page Content". These are the only required fields. </p>
